# JavaScript

Here are some resources for JS

## Starting out

[Udemy Full-Stack Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp)

- Section 1-4: HTML
- Section 5-13: CSS
- Section 14-18: JavaScript (Basics)
- Section 36: React

The resources here are all encompassing and should suffice as a sole resource for learning the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and [React](https://react.dev/). For reference, the [Army Cap Audit Tool](https://github.com/catalyze-ltd/cap_audit_fresh) is built on [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), a lightweight alternative to React. 

## Further Resources

The Udemy course provides enough to get started. These are resources that I have found useful to further strengthen existing knowledge on concepts, help with debugging, and understand new functions.
