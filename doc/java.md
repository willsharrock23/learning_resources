# Java

Java is an Object Orientated Language. It can be a great choice for a back-end when making a web-app, or a standalone executable application. A popular framework to use is Spring Boot.

## Learning Java

- [Udemy Java Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javamasterclass): This is a very in-depth resource for Java. Use this if you are learning Java for the purpose of actually developing code. This may be overkill if just for the purpose of understanding how the language works.
- [IBM Java Course, Pt 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-for-programming-beginners): This provides an introduction to Java, and skills learned here should be transferrable to learning other Object-orientated languages too.
- [IBM Java Course, Pt 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-program-in-java): This is a continuation, teaching concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces and method overloading.
